# Status of this project

I began writing some of the components of this library many years ago, and it was only recently (as of the writing of this in late 2021) that I started to combine it together into one cohesive blob. One of the main results of this is that the quality of the code is extremely variable, the testing is wildly incomplete and there are still bits which are stubbed out and are currently item 296 on my to-do list.

With all that being said, I did think that the library was sufficiently complete, functional and useful that releasing it was worth the extra effort, but whether or not I will be actively maintaining it is an open question. If anyone finds the tools here useful, or has found them to be un-useful but wishes to try and fix them, then I would welcome any contributions no matter how small or total-rewritey they are. I have attempted to open bug reports for all the things which I wanted to get around to but haven't had time for yet, so if you are interested in contributing then do make yourself known by commenting on these, opening new bugs, sending me pull requests or by any other means (although joining my parish choir out of the blue might be a *tad* on the presumptuous side).
