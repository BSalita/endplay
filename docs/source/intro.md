# What is endplay?

*endplay* is a Python library providing a variety of different tools for generating, analysing, solving and scoring bridge deals. It is a collection of different tools based on Bo Haglund's famous [dds library](https://github.com/dds-bridge/dds), Hans van Staveren's [dealer program](https://www.bridgebase.com/tools/dealer/Manual/) and other personal projects which have been cobbled together into a compatible interface using a common type system based on the encodings defined in the dds library.

If you find this useful and would like to contribute, or found it totally buggy and broken and want to fix it, then I am very open to contributions.
